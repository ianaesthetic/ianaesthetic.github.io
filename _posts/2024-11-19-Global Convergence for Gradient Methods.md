### Polyak-Lojasiewicz Condition 

#### Unconstrained Case

In the unconstrained case, the objective can be written as $\begin{aligned} \min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^d} f(x)\end{aligned}$. Here we assume the derivative of $f$ is Lipschitz-continuous: $$\begin{aligned} f(y) \leq f(x) + \langle \rangle\end{aligned}$$



We say $f(x)$ meets the Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality if the following holds for some $\mu > 0$
