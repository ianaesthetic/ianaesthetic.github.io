I'm now a lecturer in the Engineering&Technical College of Chengdu University of Technology. Before that I get my Master degree of computer technology in University of Science and Technology of China, and my bachelor degree of international finance in Shanghai University of Finance and Economics. My research interest lies in the intersection of reinforcement learning and Algorithmic Game Theory.
